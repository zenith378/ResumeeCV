  \ecvitem{}{Dipartimento di Fisica ``E. Fermi'', Università di Pisa}
\ecvitem{}{My Bachelor's thesis ``Misure di precisione dei rapporti di decadimento del bosone W con l’esperimento CMS'' was supervised by prof. Paolo Azzurri. 
   The topic for the bachelor's thesis was a precise measurement of the branching ratios of the W boson decay with the CMS experiment. For this project I had a specific focus on the study of the Lepton Universality using Monte Carlo analysis.
   Other exams include: 
   \begin{ecvitemize}
   \item Experimental Physics and Electronics
   \item Theoretical Physics: Classical Mechanics and Electrodynamics, Quantum Mechanics, Basic Nuclear Physics, Astrophysics
   \item Mathematics: Calculus, Complex Analysis, Linear Algebra
